# KMML challenge
Kernel Method for Machine Learning Kaggle challenge

## Starter pack

This code has been developed using Python 3.7.

The results are reproducible using [(Mini)conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as follow (you may want to skip to step 4 if you have a running version of Python 3.7 that includes the requirements found in ``requirements.txt``)

1. To instanciate the ``conda`` environmment, run ``conda create --file conda-env.txt --name km``
2. Activate the virtual environement, using ``conda activate km`` (or ``source activate km``)
3. Then use ``pip`` to install the required Python packages in ``requirements.txt``: ``pip -r requirements.txt``
4. Launch the main file: ``python start.py`` and grab a cup of coffee as it takes around 1 hour to complete :)
5. You can find the final results in ``Yte.csv`` inside the ``results`` folder.
