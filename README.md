## Git 101

There are 5 main commands that you need to use ``git`` efficiently:

0. ``git status`` to know what is the status of the repository (how many commits are to be pushed? how many files are untracked? how many files are added and waiting to be commited?). This is always useful.
1. ``git pull`` everytime you resume working on a repository to keep track of remote changes
2. ``git add`` to select the files you want to commit locally.
3. ``git commit -m "this is a commit"`` to commit the files along with the message "this is a commit". The ``-m`` denotes the message.
4. ``git push`` to push the local changes to the remote server.
